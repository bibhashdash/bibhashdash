    title: "Vikings Foundation",
    description: "I worked with The Vikings Foundation CIC, a local charitable organisation providing football development in Goole, to create a responsive business-card website. I made the sketches in Figma before coding it up in Next JS. The main goal was a speedy output as the client had their own programme launch deadline to meet. I wanted to keep the design simple and the colour scheme well-contrasted to ensure maximum visibility.",

    title: "New Life Support",
    description: "A project for the New Life Support charity, I used Vue JS composition API to build most of the modular components and Bootstrap to handle the heavy lifting for CSS. It ensured I could focus on design and delivering a responsive website on time whilst still keeping the code maintainable and scalable if required. The client also required a news section which allowed me to implement dynamic routing and use markdown files to serve the content.",

    description: "Perfect was a personal project. I had been keen to design a game that combined my passion for sport and coding. I took inspiration from the clean and simple UI that had made Wordle such a big hit. I used Storybook to test the various components and also implemented a Trello board to keep track of my tasks and future iterations.",

    title: "Phoenix Community Radio",
    description: "A local radio station in Goole was looking to re-launch itself and, having already volunteered for them as a presenter, I had little hesitation offering my services in coding. The timeframe was extremely tight, so I decided to utilise vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It also ensured the site was speedy to use and, crucially, integrated seamlesssly with the third-party Radio.co player component. I used Netlify to host as their in-built form handling allowed me to quickly implement a song-requests section for the listeners to utlisie. The site is used by 100s of listeners each week.",

I wanted to provide the user with seamless feedback when search results showed up, hence the use of emojis to indicate air quality. I also wanted to keep the UI simple so that data could be presented in an uncluttered manner.",
