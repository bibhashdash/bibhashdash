    description: "I worked with the Vikings Foundation CIC, a local charitable organisation providing football development in Goole, to create a business-card website. I made the sketches in Figma before coding it up in Next JS. The main goal was a speedy output as the client had their own programme launch deadline to meet. I wanted to keep the design simple and the colour scheme well-contrasted to ensure maximum visibility.",
